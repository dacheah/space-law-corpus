"""
hashing.py — content hashing for the Space Law Corpus.

A hash is a short fingerprint of a file's exact bytes. If a single character
changes, the hash changes completely. This is how we prove, years later, that a
stored text has not been silently altered.

Rules (fixed in docs/design/01-provenance-schema.md, section 4):
  * Algorithm: SHA-256, always written with the "sha256:" prefix.
  * original_sha256 is computed over the RAW BYTES of the original artifact.
  * text_sha256 is computed over the RAW BYTES of text.txt as stored
    (UTF-8, LF line endings, no BOM).
  * These are computed by tooling, never hand-edited.
